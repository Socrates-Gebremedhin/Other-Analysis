#Ethiopian Import ban Analysis

Hi,

This repository contains some analysis on the ban of imports to understand if the ban is actually significant or not.

I have conducted the analysis using jupyter notebook and should you be interested in running the program, you should have Anaconda on your computer or have any other program that can run python notebooks. If you are running it on other apps other than Anaconda, please be sure to have 'pandas' and 'matplotlib' libraries.

I also used trademap as the data source for this analysis.

If you have questions, contact me via linkdin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/socratesgebremedhin/
